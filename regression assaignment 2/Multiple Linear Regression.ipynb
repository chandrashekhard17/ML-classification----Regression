    "### Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    "**R-squared** (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It provides insight into how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "\\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}} \\]  \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}\\) = Sum of squares of residuals (difference between predicted and actual values)\n",
    "- \\(\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}\\) = Total sum of squares (variance of the dependent variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- R² = 1: Perfect fit (all variance is explained)\n",
    "- R² = 0: The model explains no variance\n",
    "- R² < 0: The model performs worse than a horizontal line\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "**Adjusted R-squared** accounts for the number of predictors in the model and adjusts the R-squared value accordingly to penalize adding irrelevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "\\[ R^2_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1 - R^2}{n - k - 1} \\times (n - 1) \\right) \\]  \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(n\\) = number of observations\n",
    "- \\(k\\) = number of predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference**: While R² can increase by merely adding more predictors (even if they are irrelevant), adjusted R² only increases if the new predictor improves the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. It accounts for model complexity and helps avoid overfitting by penalizing unnecessary predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are RMSE, MSE, and MAE in the context of regression analysis? How are these metrics calculated, and what do they represent?\n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**:  \n",
    "  \\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]  \n",
    "  Represents the square root of the average squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**:  \n",
    "  \\[ \\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\]  \n",
    "  Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:  \n",
    "  \\[ \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| \\]  \n",
    "  Calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation**:\n",
    "- RMSE: More sensitive to large errors.\n",
    "- MSE: Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.\n",
    "- MAE: Provides a straightforward average of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis.\n",
    "- **RMSE**:\n",
    "  - *Advantages*: Emphasizes larger errors due to squaring, useful when large errors are unacceptable.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantages*: Not robust to outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **MSE**:\n",
    "  - *Advantages*: Standard metric for optimization algorithms; easier to compute derivatives.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantages*: Like RMSE, it over-penalizes large errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE**:\n",
    "  - *Advantages*: Robust to outliers, providing a more balanced measure of error.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantages*: Less sensitive to large errors, so may be misleading in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "**Lasso regularization** adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Loss Function**:\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Loss} = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j| \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference from Ridge**: Ridge uses the sum of squared coefficients, while Lasso uses the sum of absolute coefficients. Lasso tends to set some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**When to use**: Lasso is preferred when you suspect many features are irrelevant and want automatic feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "Regularized models (Lasso, Ridge) add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging complex models that may overfit the data. By shrinking the magnitude of the coefficients, regularization prevents the model from fitting noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "In a high-dimensional dataset with many predictors, a standard linear regression model may fit the training data very well but generalize poorly. Adding Ridge or Lasso regularization would constrain the model's complexity, ensuring better performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Discuss the limitations of regularized linear models and explain why they may not always be the best choice for regression analysis.\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - May underfit the data if the penalty is too strong.\n",
    "  - Cannot capture complex, non-linear relationships well.\n",
    "  - Regularization assumes all features are equally important in contributing to the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the underlying relationship is non-linear, more flexible models like decision trees or neural networks might outperform regularized linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. You are comparing the performance of two regression models using different evaluation metrics. Model A has an RMSE of 10, while Model B has an MAE of 8. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any limitations to your choice of metric?\n",
    "Choosing between RMSE and MAE depends on the importance of handling large errors. RMSE gives more weight to large errors, so if minimizing large errors is critical, Model A might be preferred. However, if the goal is a more balanced error, Model B with lower MAE may be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**: MAE and RMSE focus on different aspects of error, so relying on one may not capture the full performance spectrum. Additionally, Model B’s performance could have more extreme large errors, which may not be reflected in its lower MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. You are comparing the performance of two regularized linear models using different types of regularization. Model A uses Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model B uses Lasso regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.5. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any trade-offs or limitations to your choice of regularization method?\n",
    "The choice between Ridge and Lasso depends on the dataset characteristics:\n",
    "- **Ridge (Model A)**: Tends to shrink coefficients but not set them to zero, making it better if all predictors contribute somewhat to the model.\n",
    "- **Lasso (Model B)**: Encourages sparsity, setting some coefficients to zero, so it is better if feature selection is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs**: Ridge generally performs better when most predictors are relevant. Lasso can underperform when multicollinearity is present, as it may arbitrarily select one feature over others. Model performance should be evaluated with cross-validation to choose the better method for a specific case."
